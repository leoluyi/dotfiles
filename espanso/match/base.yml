# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.

# And much more! For more information, visit the docs: https://espanso.org/docs/
matches:
  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%Y-%m-%d"

  # Use Espanso as password expander:
  # 1.  Add an "application password" to keychain (Screenshot: https://u.lillefar.dk/q2BI5m)
  # 2.  Add snippet to espanso config file where some-password is identical to account name for your keychain.

  # ```
  # - triggers: [":pass:"]
  #     replace: "{{output}}"
  #     vars:
  #       - name: output
  #         type: shell
  #         params:
  #           cmd: "security find-generic-password -a '<account_name>' -w"
  # ```

  # 3.  First time you run the expander you will be required to enter your macos password.
  - triggers: [":1pass"]
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "security find-generic-password -a 'leoluyi' -w"
